Goals
=====
1) Generates appropriate SQL statements for any number of database managment systems for the current Edge Diagrammer file, with minimal changes to the code.

2) Replaces Edge Diagrammer with some other tool or schema description file (e.g. XML), and be able to perform the same functions with minimal changes to the application itself.


SDLC
=====
Extreme Programming (XP)

Explanation
=====
For our software development methodology, we want to use an Agile SDLC because of its short development cycle and frequent releases, extreme programming is the best SDLC to use.
Extreme programming is a great way to work in groups and makes it easy to perform unit testing as well as code review. Pair programming is also an option with this SDLC. For a program such as the one given that requires extensive testing. Pair programming will give us the opportunity to use better test cases as well as better designed code. Frequent releases will also be a key to our approach by developing just passable solutions and quickly iteration on them.

Milestones
=====

Setup
-----
This milestone will be achieved when the IDE is correctly configured and the code is pushed to our Github repository.

Fast Revision
-----
This milestone will be achieved when someone makes a contribution to the project.

Testing
-----
Because XP requires frequent testing , it’s important to design tests that fully test the functionality and make sure things aren’t broken. 

Simplicity
-----
We need to keep the functionality as simple as possible to allow for easy revision.
