sqlgenerator
============

422 - App Development Practices final project. 

Goals
----
1) Generates appropriate SQL statements for any number of database managment systems for the current Edge Diagrammer file, with minimal changes to the code.
2) Replaces Edge Diagrammer with some other tool or schema description file (e.g. XML), and be able to perform the same functions with minimal changes to the application itself.

SDLC
----
We will be using Extreme Programming (XP) for our software development methodology. Because of its short development cycle and frequent releases, this is the best SDLC to use.
